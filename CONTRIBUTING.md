- [ ] Manually verify all new functionality works as expected
- [ ] Keep PRs focused and atomic

### üëÄ Review Process
1. Manually test the changes
2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address all review comments
4. Maintain clean commit history

## Coding Standards

### üíª General Guidelines
- Follow existing code style
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

## Development Setup

### üîÑ Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your LLM API keys (only set the ones you plan to use):
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=XXX
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=XXX
...
```
   - Optionally set debug level:
```bash
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in .gitignore.

### üöÄ Running the Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

**Note**: You will need Google Chrome Canary to run this locally if you use Chrome! It's an easy install and a good browser for web development anyway.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Deployment

To deploy the application to Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions and Wrangler is correctly configured for your Cloudflare account.

# Docker Deployment Documentation

This guide outlines various methods for building and deploying the application using Docker.

## Build Methods

### 1. Using Helper Scripts

NPM scripts are provided for convenient building:

```bash
# Development build
npm run dockerbuild

# Production build
npm run dockerbuild:prod
```

### 2. Direct Docker Build Commands

You can use Docker's target feature to specify the build environment:

```bash
# Development build
docker build . --target bolt-ai-development

# Production build
docker build . --target bolt-ai-production
```

### 3. Docker Compose with Profiles

Use Docker Compose profiles to manage different environments:

```bash
# Development environment
docker-compose --profile development up

# Production environment
docker-compose --profile production up
```

## Running the Application

After building using any of the methods above, run the container with:

```bash
# Development
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:development

# Production
docker run -p 5173:5173 --env-file .env.local bolt-ai:production
```

## Deployment with Coolify

[Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) provides a straightforward deployment process:

1. Import your Git repository as a new project
2. Select your target environment (development/production)
3. Choose "Docker Compose" as the Build Pack
4. Configure deployment domains
5. Set the custom start command:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile production up
   ```
6. Configure environment variables
   - Add necessary AI API keys
   - Adjust other environment variables as needed
7. Deploy the application

## VS Code Integration

The `docker-compose.yaml` configuration is compatible with VS Code dev containers:

1. Open the command palette in VS Code
2. Select the dev container configuration
3. Choose the "development" profile from the context menu

## Environment Files

Ensure you have the appropriate `.env.local` file configured before running the containers. This file should contain:
- API keys
- Environment-specific configurations
- Other required environment variables

## Notes

- Port 5173 is exposed and mapped for both development and production environments
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env.local`
- Different profiles (development/production) can be used for different deployment scenarios
- The configuration supports both local development and production deployment
